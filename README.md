🏅 Olympic Medals Prediction - ML Project
📌 Project Overview
In this project, we walk through the complete process of building a beginner-friendly machine learning model—from forming a hypothesis to evaluating model performance. The goal is to predict how many medals a country will win in upcoming Olympic games using historical Olympic data.

This end-to-end ML pipeline is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow for learners and enthusiasts alike.

To keep things engaging, we use a fun and real-world dataset from past Olympic games to uncover trends and build our predictions.

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
This project follows a structured ML pipeline, which is commonly used in most data science problems:

Form a hypothesis

Collect and explore the data

Reshape the data (if needed) to match the prediction goal

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Choose an error/accuracy metric

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Train and evaluate the model
